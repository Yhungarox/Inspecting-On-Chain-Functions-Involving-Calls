Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method: `call`, `abi.encodeWithSelector`, `abi.decode`

# Explanation

## Purpose:
The `swapExactTokensForTokens` function allows users to swap an exact amount of input tokens for a minimum amount of output tokens along a specific path. It is part of the Uniswap V2 Router contract, which facilitates token swaps on the Uniswap decentralized exchange.

## Detailed Usage:
The `call` method is used within the helper functions such as `TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom`. This method executes low-level calls to transfer tokens from the user to the Uniswap pair contract. The `call` function in Solidity is a low-level function to interact with other contracts. It is used here to ensure that tokens are transferred properly by directly interacting with the token contract's `transferFrom` method.

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address token, address from, address to, uint value) internal {
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(TRANSFER_FROM_SELECTOR, from, to, value));
    require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), 'TransferHelper: TRANSFER_FROM_FAILED');
}
```

In this snippet, `call` is used with `abi.encodeWithSelector` to encode the function selector and arguments for the `transferFrom` function. This method is necessary because it provides a way to handle token transfers safely, checking the success of the operation and reverting if the transfer fails.

## Impact:
The use of `call` in this context is crucial for interacting with ERC-20 tokens in a safe and controlled manner. By using `call`, the contract can handle errors gracefully and ensure that tokens are transferred as expected. This enhances the reliability and security of the swap function, ensuring that users can trust the protocol to execute their swaps correctly. It directly contributes to the core functionality of Uniswap, enabling seamless token swaps on a decentralized platform.
